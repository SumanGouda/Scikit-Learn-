# 📘 Scikit-Learn 4-Week Learning Journey

This repository contains my structured **4-week plan** to master [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for machine learning, along with the essential math required to understand each model. Each week is divided into daily lessons and practical exercises.

---

## 📅 Weekly Structure

Each week focuses on a key part of the ML workflow using scikit-learn, with math lessons running in parallel.

| Week | Focus Area | Topics Covered |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| [Week 1](./Week_1_Basics/Week_1_Scikit_Learn_Intro_to_Basics.ipynb) | Core ML Concepts | Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Accuracy, Train/Test Split |
| [Week 2](./Week_2_Pipelines/Week_2_Scikit_Learn_Pipelines_and_CV.ipynb) | Preprocessing & Pipelines | Encoding, Scaling, Imputation, Pipelines, Cross-validation |
| [Week 3](./Week_3_Tuning/Week_3_Model_Tuning_Evaluation.ipynb) | Model Tuning & Evaluation | GridSearchCV, ROC/AUC, F1 Score, Logistic Regression, SVM |
| [Week 4](./Week_4_Ensembles/Week_4_Advanced_and_Projects.ipynb) | Advanced Models & Projects | Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Voting, Deployment Prep |

## 🧠 Math Topics Covered

Each week includes a parallel math session to build the theoretical foundation:

- Mean, MSE, R², Euclidean distance
- Entropy, Gini impurity
- Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- ROC/AUC, Sigmoid function
- Feature importance, gradient descent basics
